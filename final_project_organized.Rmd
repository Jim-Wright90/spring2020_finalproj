Background:
This project will be a shiny app that will provide a quick look into data from three different years of the School Survey on Crime and Safety (05-06, 07-08, 17-18). The app will provide users with all the variables from these datasets that are matched between the different years. We are hoping that this shiny app will be able to provide general associations between continuous variables while being able to choose which year of the dataset the user is interested in as well as looking at differences between categories for any variable of interest. We are currently working on the shiny app and any feedback would be greatly appreciated, especially with the functions as they will be the base for the shiny app.


```{r data upload}
files <- dir_ls(here::here("data"), glob = "*.csv")

batch <- map_df(files, read_csv)
batch

batch <- batch %>% 
  mutate(fr_ubran = as.factor(fr_urban),
         fr_size = as.factor(fr_size),
         year = as.factor(c0578_yy))
```

```{r}
batch %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(mean_score = map_dbl(data, ~mean(.x$c0534))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, mean_score)) +
  geom_col()

#JW strength: great example of using map_dbl to loop through to get the mean and then plot! I'm still wrapping my head around using map_dbl() and this was helpful to see how you can use it in concert with mutate to create new columns and then visualize them. 

```

```{r parallel iteration}
comparing <- batch %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(model_1 = map(data, ~lm(c0534 ~ fr_urban, data = .x)),
         model_2 = map(data, ~lm(c0534 ~ fr_size, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(model_compare = map2(model_1, model_2, stats::AIC),
         aic_model_1 = map_dbl(model_compare, list('AIC', 1)),
         aic_model_2 = map_dbl(model_compare, list('AIC', 2)))

compare_plot <- comparing %>% 
  dplyr::select(year, aic_model_1, aic_model_2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = 'year_AIC', values_to = 'values')

```

```{r nest and mutate}
models <- batch %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(c0534 ~ c0562, data = .x))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(model, names_to = 'model', values_to = 'output') %>% 
  mutate(r2 = map_dbl(output, ~summary(.x)$r.squared))

```


```{r}
# Function 1
numeric_plot <- function(df, x, y){
  plot_num <- ggplot({{df}}, aes({{x}}, {{y}})) +
      geom_point(alpha = .4, color = 'gray70') +
      geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
  
  if(!as.numeric({{x}}) & !as.numeric({{y}})){
    stop()
  }
  else{
    plot_num
  }
  return(plot_num)
}

numeric_plot(batch, batch$c0534, batch$c0536) +
  labs(x = 'X Value',
       y = 'Y Value',
       Title = 'A Title',
       caption = 'R2') +
  facet_wrap(~year)

#JW suggestion: you could write your desired lables into the function itself, rather than when you call the function? 

#JW something I learned: This is super helpful for me to see! I've also tried writing a function to create plots, and one thing I always forget is to assign an object and call return(that_object) within the function, as you've done on line 75. 

```

```{r}
# Function 2
bar_plot <- function(df, x, y, fill){
  plot_cat <- ggplot({{df}}, aes({{x}}, {{y}}, {{fill}})) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
  
  if(!as.numeric({{x}}) & !as.numeric({{y}})){
    stop()
  }
  else{
    plot_cat
  }
return(plot_cat)
}

bar_plot(batch, batch$fr_urban, batch$c0534, fill = batch$fr_urban) +
  labs(x = 'X Value',
       y = 'Y Value',
       Title = 'A Title',
       caption = 'R2') +
  facet_wrap(~year)

# JW strength: I'm super impressed with your use of conditions in your functions! Makes sense to require that both x and y data are numeric in order to run the function. 

```



### Nest and Mutate (Claire Zhang)

I'll use the original four years' datasets (05-06, 07-08, 15-16, 17-18) from the NCES website, https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/, and select variables of interest that are available across all four years including urbanicity, school size, percentage of low-performing students, percentage of college-going students, and total numbers of a) incidents reported, b) incidents reported to police, and c) out-of-school suspensions.

step 1, prepare four-year data:

```{r}
sf06 <- import(here("data_1", "pu_ssocs06_spss.sav"),
               setclass = "tbl_df") %>%
        select(urbanicity = FR_LOC4,
               size = FR_SIZE,
               low_performing = C0532,
               college_going = C0534,
               incidents = INCID06,
               incidents_police = INCPOL06,
               suspension = OUTSUS06) %>% 
        mutate(year = "2006")

sf08 <- import(here("data_1", "pu_ssocs08_spss.sav"),
               setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
        select(urbanicity = FR_URBAN,
               size = FR_SIZE,
               low_performing = C0532,
               college_going = C0534,
               incidents = INCID08,
               incidents_police = INCPOL08,
               suspension = OUTSUS08)%>% 
        mutate(year = "2008")

sf16 <- import(here("data_1", "pu_ssocs16.sas7bdat"),
               setclass = "tbl_df")%>% 
        select(urbanicity = FR_URBAN,
               size = FR_SIZE,
               low_performing = C0532,
               college_going = C0534,
               incidents = INCID16,
               incidents_police = INCPOL16,
               suspension = OUTSUS16)%>% 
        mutate(year = "2016")

sf18 <- import(here("data_1", "pu_ssocs18.sav"),
               setclass = "tbl_df")%>% 
        select(urbanicity = FR_URBAN,
               size = FR_SIZE,
               low_performing = C0532,
               college_going = C0534,
               incidents = INCID18,
               incidents_police = INCPOL18,
               suspension = OUTSUS18)%>% 
        mutate(year = "2018")

four_year <- bind_rows(sf06, sf08, sf16, sf18)%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(incidents, incidents_police, suspension),
                          names_to = "safety_indicators",
                          values_to = "total") %>% 
  mutate(urbanicity = recode(urbanicity, 
                             '1' = "City", 
                             '2' = "Suburb", 
                             '3' = "Town", 
                             '4' = "Rural"),
         size = recode(size, 
                       '1' = "<300", 
                       '2' = "300-499", 
                       '3' = "500-999", 
                       '4' = "1,000+"),
         size = fct_relevel(size, 
                            "<300", 
                            "300-499", 
                            "500-999", 
                            "1,000+"))

#JW suggestion: this is very minor, but I added an empty line between your objects. Otherwise it looks to the reader like it's all one action. I also changed the code styling a bit for your recoding so that it's easier to read.

```

step 2, inspect the four year data

```{r}
full_plot1 <- four_year %>%
  group_by(year, safety_indicators) %>% 
  mutate(mean = mean(total)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(year = readr::parse_number(year)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, mean))+
  geom_line(aes(color = safety_indicators), size = 0.9)+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "School Safety from 2006 to 2018",
       x = "School Year",
       y = "Average Number of Cases in School",
       fill = "Safety Indicators")

full_plot1
```

step 3, nest by year and visualize school safety, size, and urbanicity

```{r}
plot1 <- function(x){
  x %>%
    ggplot(aes(size, total))+
    geom_col(aes(fill = safety_indicators),
             position = "dodge")+
    facet_wrap(~urbanicity)+
    theme_minimal()+
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")+
    labs(title = "School Safety, School Size, and Urbanicity",
         x = "School Size",
         y = "Total Number of Cases",
         fill = "Safety Indicators")
}

plot1(four_year)

plot1_by_year <- four_year %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plot = map(data, ~plot1(.x)))

plot1_by_year$plot[[1]]
plot1_by_year$plot[[2]]
plot1_by_year$plot[[3]]
plot1_by_year$plot[[4]]

#JW strength: These plots are so impressive! Facet_wrapping by setting as you've done is interesting. And the way you tried out plot1() on four_year to get an overall plot, and thenn nested your data by year and looped through using your function, is so clever. Acutally, I'm doing something similar in my project and will refer to this as a helpful example! 
#JW suggestion: I suggest with your function calling your argument something more specific than x. It looks like the input should be the data frame, so on line 227, you could have 'df' instead of 'x', and then again on 228.  

```

```{r walk reduce or modify used}

fs::dir_create(here::here("plots_1", "indicators"))


files <- plot1_by_year$year
paths <- here::here("plots_1", "indicators", glue("{files}.png"))
paths

walk2(paths, plot1_by_year$plot, ggsave,
      width = 9.5, 
      height = 6.5,
      dpi = 500)
```
